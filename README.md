# UNetSegmentation
Project for AI course at TCS, comperring different UNet-like models for Semantic Understanding of Urban Street Scenes🚗🏢🚦🛣️.

For this purpouse I have used [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com) which consists of 3475 fine annotated images of german, french and swiss roads.


## Models
I have compared three different models: 

1.__U-Net Xception-style model__ based on [keras implementation](https://keras.io/examples/vision/oxford_pets_image_segmentation/)

2.__Variation on classic U-Net__ 

3.__U-Net with additional attention mechanism__ based on approach from this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03999)
